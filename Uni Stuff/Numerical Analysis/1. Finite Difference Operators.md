# Finite Differences
Given the function $y = f(x)$, $x$ is called called an **argument** and $y$ is called an **entry**.

Here values of arguments are given at equal intervals 
$a, a+h, a+2h, ..., a+nh$

Corresponding values of $y$ are:
$f(a), f(a+h), f(a+2h), ..., f(a+nh)$

So we can write:
$f(a+h)-a, f(a+2h)-f(a+h),...,f(a+nh)-f(a+(n-1)h)$

such a representation is called **finite differences**

## Finite difference operators
There are five differnce operators, namely:

1. Forward Difference Operator $\Delta$
2. Backward Difference Operator $\nabla$
3. The Shifting Opetator $\text{E}$
4. Central Difference Operator $\delta$
5. The Averaging Operator $\mu$

## Forward difference operator $\Delta$
Consider the function $y = f(x)$ 

Given the values of the function at points 
$x_0, x_1 = x_0+h, x_2 = x_0+2h,..., x_n = x_0+nh$.

Let $y_0 = f(x_0), y_1 = f(x_1), ..., y_n = f(y_n)$.

We define 
$$\Delta[f(x)]=f(x+h)-f(x)$$

Thus $\Delta y_0=f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)=f(x_1)-f(x_0)=y_1-y_0=\Delta f(x_0)$.

$$\therefore \Delta y_0 = y_1 - y_0$$

Further, $x_0, x_1,...,x_n$ are called arguments. The corresponding $f(x)$ values are called entries and $h$ is the interval of differencing. 

Similarly, 

$\begin{align} &\Delta y_0 = y_1 - y_0 \\&\;.\\&\;.\\&\;. \\ &\Delta y_n = y_{n+1} - y_n \end{align}$

$\Delta$ is known as the **forward difference operator** and $\delt$
