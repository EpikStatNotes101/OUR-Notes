# Finite Differences
Given the function $y = f(x)$, $x$ is called called an **argument** and $y$ is called an **entry**.

Here values of arguments are given at equal intervals 
$$a, a+h, a+2h, ..., a+nh$$

Corresponding values of $y$ are:
$$f(a), f(a+h), f(a+2h), ..., f(a+nh)$$

So we can write:
$$f(a+h)-a, f(a+2h)-f(a+h),...,f(a+nh)-f(a+(n-1)h)$$ 

such a representation is called **finite differences**

## Finite Difference Operators
There are five differnce operators, namely:

1. Forward Difference Operator $\Delta$
2. Backward Difference Operator $\nabla$
3. The Shifting Opetator $\text{E}$
4. Central Difference Operator $\delta$
5. The Averaging Operator $\mu$
