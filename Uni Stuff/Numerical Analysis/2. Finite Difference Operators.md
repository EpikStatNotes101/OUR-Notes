# Finite Differences
Given the function $y = f(x)$, $x$ is called called an **argument** and $y$ is called an **entry**.

Here values of arguments are given at equal intervals 
$a, a+h, a+2h, ..., a+nh$

Corresponding values of $y$ are:
$f(a), f(a+h), f(a+2h), ..., f(a+nh)$

So we can write:
$f(a+h)-a, f(a+2h)-f(a+h),...,f(a+nh)-f(a+(n-1)h)$

such a representation is called **finite differences**

## Finite difference operators
There are five differnce operators, namely:

1. Forward Difference Operator $\Delta$
2. Backward Difference Operator $\nabla$
3. The Shifting Opetator $\text{E}$
4. Central Difference Operator $\delta$
5. The Averaging Operator $\mu$

## Forward difference operator $\Delta$
Consider the function $y = f(x)$ 

Given the values of the function at points 
$x_0, x_1 = x_0+h, x_2 = x_0+2h,..., x_n = x_0+nh$.

Let $y_0 = f(x_0), y_1 = f(x_1), ..., y_n = f(y_n)$.

We define 
$$\Delta[f(x)]=f(x+h)-f(x)$$

Thus $\Delta y_0=f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)=f(x_1)-f(x_0)=y_1-y_0=\Delta f(x_0)$.

$$\therefore \Delta y_0 = y_1 - y_0$$

Further, $x_0, x_1,...,x_n$ are called arguments. The corresponding $f(x)$ values are called entries and $h$ is the interval of differencing. 

Similarly, 

$$\begin{align} &\Delta y_0 = y_1 - y_0 \\&\;.\\&\;.\\&\;. \\ &\Delta y_n = y_{n+1} - y_n \end{align}$$

$\Delta$ is known as the **forward difference operator** and $\Delta y_0, \Delta y_1, ..., \Delta y_{n-1}$ are called the **first forward difference** of the function $y=f(x)$.

The second order differences of the function are defined by

$$\begin{align} &\Delta^2 y_0 = \Delta y_1 - \Delta y_0 \\ &\Delta^2 y_1 = \Delta y_2 - \Delta y_1 \\&\;.\\&\;.\\&\;. \\ &\Delta^2 y_{n-1} = \Delta y_{n} - \Delta y_{n-1} \end{align}$$

Similarly, in general the $n^{\text{th}}$ order differences are defined as
$$\Delta^n y_i = \Delta^{n-1}y_{i+1} - \Delta^{n-1}y_{i}$$

The differences of the function can be systematically represented in the form of a table called the **forward difference table**. 

## Backward difference operator $\nabla$
Consider the function $y=f(x)$

Given the values of the function at points 
$x_0, x_1 = x_0+h, x_2 = x_0+2h,..., x_n = x_0+nh$.

Let $y_0 = f(x_0), y_1 = f(x_1), ..., y_n = f(y_n)$.

We define 
$$\nabla[f(x)]=f(x)-f(x-h)$$

Thus $\nabla y_1=f(x_1)-f(x_1-h)=f(x_1)-f(x_0)=y_1-y_0=\nabla f(x_1)$.

$$\therefore \nabla y_1 = y_1 - y_0$$

Further, $x_0, x_1,...,x_n$ are called arguments. The corresponding $f(x)$ values are called entries and $h$ is the interval of differencing. 

Similarly, 

$$\begin{align} &\nabla y_2 = y_2 - y_1 \\&\;.\\&\;.\\&\;. \\ &\nabla y_n = y_n - y_{n-1}  \end{align}$$

$\nabla$ is known as the **backward difference operator** and $\nabla y_1, \nabla y_1, ..., \Delta y_{n}$ are called the **first backward difference** of the function $y=f(x)$.

The second order differences of the function are defined by

$$\begin{align} &\nabla^2 y_2 = \nabla y_2 - \nabla y_1 \\ &\nabla^2 y_3 = \nabla y_3 - \nabla y_2 \\&\;.\\&\;.\\&\;. \\ &\nabla^2 y_{n} = \nabla y_{n} - \nabla y_{n-1} \end{align}$$

Similarly, in general the $n^{\text{th}}$ order differences are defined as
$$\nabla^n y_i = \nabla^{n-1}y_{i} - \nabla^{n-1}y_{i-1}$$

The differences of the function can be systematically represented in the form of a table called the **backward difference table**. 

**Remark :** The relation between the two difference operators is given by

## The shifting opetator $\text{E}$
## Central difference operator $\delta$
## The averaging operator $\mu$
