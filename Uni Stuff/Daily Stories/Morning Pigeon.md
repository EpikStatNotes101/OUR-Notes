This morning when I was in the middle of my waking up process, like processing the need to get up, then proceeding to slowly open my eyes and finally unwilling embrace this so called reality, I was completely freaked out by this knocking sound on the window of my room. I wondered if this was some psychopath or some mentally unsound angry neighbour knocking on 21 year old guy's window at 7 in the morning? It took some time but when I finally recollected myself and gathered enough courage to look at the window, I was astonished. It was a pigeon, glaring at me like some pakistani sniper looking at his target through a scope, ready to put a bullet through their head at any moment.
