# Tables in SAS
*Example SAS sintax to create a table *

```sas
data weight_club;
input IdNumber 1-4 Name $ 6-24 Team $ StartWeight EndWeight;
Loss=StartWeight-EndWeight;
datalines;
1023 David Shaw         red 189 165
1049 Amelia Serrano     yellow 145 124
1219 Alan Nance         red 210 192
1246 Ravi Sinha         yellow 194 177
1078 Ashley McKnight    red 127 118
;
run;
```

`data` keyboard is used to define the table name (table names must not contain spaces)

`input` keyword is used to define the column names.

`Loss=StartWeight-EndWeight` is used to defined a new colum named `Loss` derived from `StartWeight` and `EndWeight`.

`dataline` or `cards` is used to indicate the beginning of the table.

`IdNumber 1-4` is used to state that the characters in position `1-4` of each row would fall under the column `IdNumber` and similarly for  `Name $ 6-24`. This eliminates the need of delimiters. 

The `$` after `Name` and `Team` indicates that values of the `Name` and `Team` columns are strings.

All command lines end with semicolons `;`.
