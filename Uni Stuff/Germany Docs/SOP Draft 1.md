### "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" ~ Wayne Gretzky

We are living in the era of **Industrial Revolution 4.0**,  where breakthroughs are being made everytime you blink your eye. Being conscious of the constant exponential developments in technology of the present time, I have always had a craving to learn about the advancements in technology and research in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. My fascinations with the developments in this field have intruiged me to dwell on how we can use this technology to make the existing systems more effective and efficient. One of my greatest inspirations in this field was Google's **Deep Mind** where the **AI** taught itself to walk. Since Research and Data Science were always my passion, it deepened my aspirations towards this domain, and that deepend my urge to gain a strong understanding in **Mathametics** and **Statistics** to reinforce my foundation in the field and hence got me admitted to **Amity University, Kolkata** for a **three years bachelor's course** on **Statistics**. I felt that undergraduate study alone does not provide the specialized academic exposure essential to reach higher professional levels in the present-day technology driven industry. Hence, I intend to pursue my master’s from a university that offers me a course that can sharpen my acumen in research. Therefore, my resolution to pursue my Master’s degree in Data Science from **\<YOUR UNIVERSITY>** seems the most logical extension of my academic career that would give me the desired push towards a research career and an opportunity to do well with the help of your dynamic curriculum and exceptional teaching faculty.

Being a tailored curriculum for bachelor's degree in Statistics, subjects like **descriptive statistics, probability theory, sampling theory, linear statistical models, statistical inference, real analysis, linear algebra, numerical analysis, C programming and R programming**
