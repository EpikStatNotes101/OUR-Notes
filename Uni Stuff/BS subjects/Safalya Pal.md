No, as a human you add your own meaning to life. Otherwise biologically the end goal of life has always just been to make your species survive longer either by surving longer individually or by reproducing.

Exploring and conquering the universe.

I don't know 

#### Q4. Does faith exist if so do we have free will ?

Yes faith exists and judging from a normal human's perspective, we do have free will and even if it was just an illusion and we didn't actually have free will, you'd never know because you'd never fully understand the higher order systems which would be determining all your actions.
