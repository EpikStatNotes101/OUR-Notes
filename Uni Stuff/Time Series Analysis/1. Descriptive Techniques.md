# Descriptive Techniques 

## Types of Variation

When the graph of a time series is plotted, we observe some haphazard changes in the graph over time. A part of this change, called the **systematic part** and can be accounted for while the remaining part is irregular. The systematic parts consist of : 

- Secular Variation / Trend 
- Seasonal Variation 
- Cyclical Variation 

Thus the value of the time series at time $t$, $Y_t$ is the resultant of the combined effect of trend $(T_t)$, seasonal variation $(S_t)$, cyclical fluctuations $(C_t)$ and irregular variations $(I_t)$.


### Trend 
The smooth, regular, long-term movement of a series observed over a long period of time is called **trend**.

A series may change its course after some time but sudden or frequent changes are quite inconsistent with the idea of trend. 

A series may show an upward or downward trend or may remain at more or less a constant level. 

### Seasonal Effect
Periodic movement (i.e. movement that repets itself at regular time intervals) of a series where the period is not larger than a year is called **seasonal variation** or **seasonality** or **seasonal effect**. e.g. climatic changes, increase in sale of certain consumer goods during festivals.

### Cyclic Changes 
The kind of oscillatory movement in a time series with period of occilation being more than a year is called **cyclic change** or **cyclic variation** or **cyclicity**. One complete period is called a **cycle**. These variations though more or less regular are note necessarily periodic.

### Irregular Fluctuations 
Apart from regular variations, all series contain a random / irregular factor which is not accounted for by trend, seasonal and cyclic variations. These variables are purely random or are completely unaccounted for or are caused by unpredectible events. 

## Models for Expressing $Y_t$
There are two approaches by which we can express $Y_t$.

### Additive Model / Sum Model 
Here, $Y_t$ is expressed as, 
$$Y_t = T_t+S_t+C_t+I_t$$

Here, all the components have the same unit as $Y_t$.

### Multiplicative Model / Product Model
Here, $Y_t$ is expressed as, 
$$Y_t = T_t\cdot S_t\cdot C_t\cdot I_t$$

Here, $T_t$ has the same unit as $Y_t$ whereas $S_t,C_t,I_t$ are unit free. 

> **Note** 
> In additive model, all the components are assumed to be independent but in multiplicative model, no such assumption is made. However in reality, these four components are highly inter-related and hence cannot be independent. So generally, multiplicative model is preferred over additive model. 

> **Note** 
> To convert a multiplicative model into an additive model, we take the logarithm of it. 
> $$\ln Y_t = \ln (T_t\cdot S_t\cdot C_t\cdot I_t)$$
> $$\Rightarrow \ln Y_t = \ln T_t +\ln S_t +\ln C_t +\ln I_t$$
> $$\Rightarrow Y'_t = T'_t+S'_t+C'_t+I'_t$$
