# Descriptive Techniques 

## Types of Variation

### Seasonal Effect
### Cyclic Changes 
### Trend 
### Irregular Fluctuations 

## Model
Additive and Multiplicative 

## Measurement of Trend 
To measure trend we need to eliminate the other elements, mainly cyclical and seasonal since irregularity is hard to remove. 

### Methods of Measuring trend 
1. Method of free-hand curve fitting (pretty much useless)
2. Method of moving averages 
3. Method of mathametical curves

> **Note** 
> if your data has cyclicality and proper seasonality, method of moving average is the best. If your data doesn't have cyclicality then method of mathametical curves is preferred.
