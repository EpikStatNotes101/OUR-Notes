# Descriptive Techniques 

## Types of Variation

When the graph of a time series is plotted, we observe some haphazard changes in the graph over time. A part of this change, called the **systematic part** and can be accounted for while the remaining part is irregular. The systematic parts consist of : 

- Secular Variation / Trend 
- Seasonal Variation 
- Cyclical Variation 

Thus the value of the time series at time $t$, $Y_t$ is the resultant of the combined effect of trend $(T_t)$, seasonal variation $(S_t)$, cyclical fluctuations $(C_t)$ and irregular variations $(I_t)$


### Trend 
The smooth, regular, long-term movement of a series observed over a long period of time is called **trend**

A series may change its course after some time but sudden or frequent changes are quite inconsistent with the idea of trend. 

A series may show an upward or downward trend or may remain at more or less a constant level. 

### Seasonal Effect
Periodic movement (i.e. movement that repets itself at regular time intervals) of a series where the period is not larger than a year (cycle) is called **seasonal variation** or **seasonality** or **seasonal effect**. e.g. climatic changes, increase in sale of certain consumer goods during festivals. 

### Cyclic Changes 


### Irregular Fluctuations
