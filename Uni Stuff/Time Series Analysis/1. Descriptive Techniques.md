# Descriptive Techniques 

## Types of Variation

When the graph of a time series is plotted, we observe some haphazard changes in the graph over time. A part of this change, called the **systematic part** and can be accounted for while the remaining part is irregular. The systematic parts consist of : 

- Secular Variation / Trend 
- Seasonal Variation 
- Cyclical Variation 

Thus the value of the time series at time $t$, $Y_t$ is the resultant of the combined effect of trend $(T_t)$, seasonal variation $(S_t)$, cyclical fluctuations $(C_t)$ and irregular variations $(I_t)$


### Trend 
The smooth, regular, long-term movement of a series observed over a long period of time is called **trend**
### Seasonal Effect
### Cyclic Changes 
### Irregular Fluctuations 

## Model
Additive and Multiplicative 

## Measurement of Trend 
To measure trend we need to eliminate the other elements, mainly cyclical and seasonal since irregularity is hard to remove. 

### Methods of Measuring trend 
1. Method of free-hand curve fitting (pretty much useless)
2. Method of moving averages 
3. Method of mathametical curves

> **Note** 
> if your data has cyclicality and proper seasonality, method of moving average is the best. If your data doesn't have cyclicality then method of mathametical curves is preferred.
