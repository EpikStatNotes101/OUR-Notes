# Measurement of Seasonal Variation 
There are three ways to measure seasonal variation, 
1. Averages of unadjusted data / Method of monthly (or quarterly) averages
2. Ratio to moving average 
3. Ratio to trend 

> **Note**
> Here we assume a multiplicative model unless stated otherwise 

## Averages of Unadjusted Data
When there is no trend or cyclical variation in the series then we use this method to find the seasonal variation. Here the only thing we have to eliminate are the irregular variations and that is done by averaging the monthly / quarterly/ weekly values over different time points.
