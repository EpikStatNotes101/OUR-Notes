# Forecasting
## Exponential Smoothing 
This forecasting procedure should be used in it's basic form for non-seasonal time series showing no systematic trend. 

Given a non seasonal time series with no systematic trend $x_1, x_2, ..., x_N$. 

$x_{N+1}$ is estimated as a weighted sum of the past $N$ observations. 

$$\hat{x}(N,1)=C_0\cdot x_N+C_1\cdot x_{N-1}+C_2\cdot x_{N-2}+...$$

..(1)

It's sensible to weigh the recent observations more than the past ones. In order for the weights we take 

$C_i = \alpha\cdot(1-\alpha)^i$

where $i=0,1,2,...$ and constant $\alpha\in(0,1)$

Hence, 

$$\hat{x}(N,1)=\alpha\cdot x_N+\alpha\cdot(1-\alpha)\cdot x_{N-1}+\alpha\cdot(1-\alpha)^2\cdot x_{N-2}+...$$

..(2)

Here we assume that there are infinite time points but in practice the datasets only contain a finite number of time points and hence eq (2) can be rewritten as:

$$\hat{x}(N,1)=\alpha\cdot x_N+(1-\alpha)\cdot \hat{x}(N-1,1)$$

For $N = 1$, we set the initial value of $\hat{x}(N,1)$ as 

$\hat{x}(1,1)=x_1$

To estimate $\alpha$, we minimise the SSE as follows :

$\hat{x}(1,1)=x_1$
$e_2 = x_2 - \hat{x}(1,1)$
$\hat{x}(2,1)=\alpha\cdot e_2$
$\hat{x}(2,1)=\hat{x}(1,1)$

## Holt's Linear Trend Method

Given a non-seasonal time series data with presence of trend $x_1, x_2, ..., x_N$. To estimate $X_{N+h}$, we find

Level : $L_N$, Trend : $T_N$, Seasonal Index : $I_N$
