# Measurement of Trend
To measure trend we need to eliminate the other elements, mainly cyclical and seasonal since irregularity is hard to remove. 

### Methods of Measuring trend 
1. Method of free-hand curve fitting (pretty much useless)
2. Method of moving averages 
3. Method of mathametical curves

> **Note** 
> if your data has cyclicality and proper seasonality, method of moving average is the best. If your data doesn't have cyclicality then method of mathametical curves is preferred. 


## Method of Mathametical Curves
1. Straight Line Trend (Linear Trend)
$$T_t = a +b\cdot t, \;\;\; b\neq0$$
2. Second Degree Polynomial (Parabolic Trend)
$$T_t = a +b\cdot t+c\cdot t^2, \;\;\; c\neq0$$
3. Exponential Curve 
$$T_t = a\cdot b^t, \;\;\; a>0$$
4. Modified Exponential Curve 
$$T_t = k+a\cdot b^t, \;\;\; k>0$$
5. Gompertz 
$$T_t = k\cdot a^{b^t}, \;\;\; k>0$$

### Linear Trend 
$Y_t$ = observed value of the time series at time $t$
$T_t$ = $a+b\cdot t$ (Estimated from the graphical representation)

#### Method of Least Squares

$$S=\sum_t(Y_t-T_t)^2$$ \[ To be minimised w.r.t. $a$ and $b$ \]
$$S=\sum_t(Y_t-a-b\cdot t)^2$$

$$\therefore \frac{\delta S}{\delta a}=0$$
$$\Rightarrow -2\sum_t(Y_t-a-b\cdot t)=0$$
$$\Rightarrow \sum_t Y_t=n\cdot a + b\sum_t t$$ ..(1)

$$\therefore \frac{\delta S}{\delta b}=0$$
$$\Rightarrow -2\sum_t(Y_t-a-b\cdot t)\cdot t=0$$
$$\Rightarrow \sum_t t\cdot Y_t=a\sum_t t + b\sum_t t^2$$ ..(2)

eq 1 anbd 2 are called the **normal equations**

### Second Degree Polynomial (Parabolic Trend)
$$T_t = a +b\cdot t+c\cdot t^2$$
$$S=\sum_t(Y_t-a-b\cdot t-c\cdot t^2)^2$$ \[ To be minimised w.r.t. $a, b$ and $c$ \]

### Exponential Curve 
Here the trend eq us given by 

$$Y_t = a\cdot b^t, \;\;\; a,b>0$$

$\therefore \log{Y_t} = \log{a}+t\log{b}$
i.e. $\log{Y_t}$ is a linear function of $t$ 

Note that $\frac{Y_t}{Y_{t-1}}=b$, i.e. the exponential curve indicates a constant ratio of change

> **Note :** if $0<b<1$, the value of $Y_t$ gradually decays but if $b>1$, the value of $Y_t$ gradually increases

#### Fitting an exponential curve

Let the trend eq be 
$$T_t = a\cdot b^t$$
$$\Rightarrow \log{T_t} = \log{a} + t\log{b}$$
