### Q1. 
Consider the experiment in which we record $M(t)$, the number of active calls at a telephone switch at time $t$, for each second over an interval of 15 minutes. Determine the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{M(t):t\geq 0\right\}$.

#### Answer
State space $S_X  =\left\{0, 1, 2, ..., 900\right\}$
Index set $T_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$

### Q2. 
6 green balls and 4 white balls are placed in two boxes $A$ and $B$ such that each box has 5 balls. At each stage, a ball is drawn at random from each box and two balls are interchanged.

(a) Let $X_n$ denote the number of white balls in box $A$ after the $n^{\text{th}}$ draw. Find the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{X_n\right\}$.

(b) Let $Y_n$ denote the number of green balls in box $A$ after the $n^{\text{th}}$ draw. Find the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{Y_n\right\}$.

#### Answer 
##### part (a)
State space $S_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\right\}$
Index set $T_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$
##### part (b)
State space $S_Y = \left\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\right\}$
Index set $T_Y = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$

### Q3. 
A box contains 3 black and 7 white balls. At each trial, a ball is drawn randomly from the box. If it is white, it is put back into the box and if it is black, it is kept outside the box. Let $X_n$ denote the number of black balls taken out of the box after the $n^{\text{th}}$ trial. Find the state space and the index of the stochastic process $\left\{X_n\right\}$.

#### Answer 
State space $S_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, 3\right\}$
Index set $T_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$

### Q4.
Suppose a coin is tossed 15 times. Let $X_n$ denote the total number of "heads" which appear up to the $n^{\text{th}}$ toss. Find the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{X_n\right\}$.

#### Answer 
State space $S_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ..., 15\right\}$
Index set $T_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ..., 15\right\}$

### Q5. 
Consider an acceptance sampling plan. Let $D_n$ denote the number of defective items after inspecting $n$ items. Find the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{D_n\right\}$.
#### Answer 
State space $S_D = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$
Index set $T_D = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$

### Q6. 
$M$ coins are placed in a row on a table. At each stage, a coin is selected at random and turned over. Let $X_n$ denote the total number of "heads" out of the $M$ coins after the $n^{\text{th}}$ trial. Find the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{X_n\right\}$.
#### Answer 
State space $S_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ..., M\right\}$
Index set $T_X = \left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$
