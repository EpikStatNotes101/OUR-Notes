### Q1. 
Consider the experiment in which we record $M(t)$, the number of active calls at a telephone switch at time $t$, for each second over an interval of 15 minutes. Determine the state space and the index set of the stochastic process $\left\{M(t):t\geq 0\right\}$

#### Answer
State space = $\left\{0, 1, 2, ..., 900\right\}$
Index set = $\left\{0, 1, 2, ...\right\}$

### Q2. 
6 green balls and 4 white balls are placed in two boxes $A$ and $B$ such that each box has 5 balls. At each stage, a ball is drawn at random from each box and two balls are interchanged.

(a) Let $X_n$ denote the number of white balls in box $A$ after the $n^{\text{th}}$ draw
