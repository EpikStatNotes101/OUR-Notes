# Common Stochastic Processes
A list of some special stochastic processes and their properties 

## The Bernoulli process
The stochastic process $\left\{X_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ is called a **Bernoulli process** with success probablity $p$ if,

1. $X_1, X_2, ...$ are independent 
2. $P(X_n = 1) = p. P(X_n = 0) = 1-p = q$. for all $n$
