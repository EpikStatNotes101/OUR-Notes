# Common Stochastic Processes
A list of some special stochastic processes and their properties 

## The Bernoulli process
The stochastic process $\left\{X_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ is called a **Bernoulli process** with success probablity $p$ if,

1. $X_1, X_2, ...$ are independent 
2. $P(X_n = 1) = p. P(X_n = 0) = 1-p = q$. for all $n$

The Bernoulli process $\left\{X(n)\right\}$ has state space $S=\left\{0,1\right\}$ and index set $T=\left\{1,2,3,...\right\}$

## The Binomial process
Let $\left\{X_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ be a Bernoulli process with success probability $p$ and let 
$$S=\left\{\begin{align} &0, &n=0 \\ &X_1+ X_2+..., &n = 1, 2, ...\end{align}\right.$$
Then $S_n$ is the number of successes in the first $n$ Bernoulli trials. Thus, 

$P\left(S_n=k\right)=\binom{n}{k}\cdot p^k\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}, \;\; k=0,1,...,n$

The stochastic process $\left\{S_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ is called a **Binomial process**. The state space of the binomial process $\left\{S_n\right\}$ is $S=\left\{1,2,...,n\right\}$ while the index set is $T=\left\{1,2,...\right\}$

## The Poisson process
A poisson process of intensity $\lambda>0$ is an integer-valued stochastic process $\left\{N(t):t\geq 0\right\}$ with the following properties:

1. $N(0)=0$.
2. For $s>t,t>0$, the random variable $N(t+s)-N(t)$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda s$.
3. $N(t)$ has independent increments.
