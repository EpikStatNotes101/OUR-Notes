# Common Stochastic Processes
A list of some special stochastic processes and their properties 

## The Bernoulli process
The stochastic process $\left\{X_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ is called a **Bernoulli process** with success probablity $p$ if,

1. $X_1, X_2, ...$ are independent 
2. $P(X_n = 1) = p. P(X_n = 0) = 1-p = q$. for all $n$

The Bernoulli process $\left\{X(n)\right\}$ has state space $S=\left\{0,1\right\}$ and index set $T=\left\{1,2,3,...\right\}$

## The Binomial process
Let $\left\{X_n:n=1,2,...\right\}$ be a Bernoulli process with success probability $p$ and let 
$$S=\left\{\begin{flalign} &0, &n=0 \\ &b &k\end{flalign}\right.$$
