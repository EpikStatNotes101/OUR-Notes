# Intro
## Stochastic Process
A stochastic process is a family of random varibles $X(t)$ parameterized by an index $t$ belonging to an index set $T$. 

e.g. let $T = \left\{1, 2, ...\right\}$
then the collection $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is a stochastic process

## Index Set
The index set is the set $T$ for which a stochastic process is defined as $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ 

If the set $T$ is discrete (countable) then the stochastic process $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called a **discrete time stochastic process**. In such cases we use $n$ instead of $t$ to denote the index.

If $T$ is continous (uncountable) then $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **continous time stochastic process**. 

## State Space 
Any possible value which the random variable $X(t)$ can take is called a **state** and the collection of all possible states of $X(t)$ is called the **state space** of the stochastic process $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$, denoted by $S$

If the state space of $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is discrete then  $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **discrete state stochastic process**. If the state space of $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is continous then $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **continous state stochastic process**.

## Properties of Stochastic Processes
Types of stochastic processes characterized by dependence relationships among $X(t)$.

### Process with independent increments 
For a stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$. If the random variables $X(t_2)-X(t_1), X(t_3)-X(t_2), ...X(t_n)-X(t_{n-1})$, are independent for all $t_1, t_2, ...t_n$, satisfying $t_1< t_2 < ...<t_n$, then $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ is a stochastic process with **independent increments**


### Process with Markovian property
$P(\text{ future } | \text{ present }, \text{ past })=P(\text{ future } | \text{ present })$
The Markovian property states that for a the future state depends
