# Intro
## Stochastic Process
A stochastic process is a family of random varibles $X(t)$ parameterized by an index $t$ belonging to an index set $T$. 

e.g. let $T = \left\{1, 2, ...\right\}$
then the collection $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is a stochastic process.

## Index Set
The index set is the set $T$ for which a stochastic process is defined as $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$.

If the set $T$ is discrete (countable) then the stochastic process $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called a **discrete time stochastic process**. In such cases we use $n$ instead of $t$ to denote the index.

If $T$ is continous (uncountable) then $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **continous time stochastic process**. 

## State Space 
Any possible value which the random variable $X(t)$ can take is called a **state** and the collection of all possible states of $X(t)$ is called the **state space** of the stochastic process $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$, denoted by $S$.

If the state space of $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is discrete then  $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **discrete state stochastic process**. If the state space of $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is continous then $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is called **continous state stochastic process**.

## Properties of Stochastic Processes
Types of stochastic processes characterized by dependence relationships among $X(t)$.

### Process with independent increments 
For a stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$. If the random variables $X(t_2)-X(t_1), X(t_3)-X(t_2), ...X(t_n)-X(t_{n-1})$, are independent for all $t_1, t_2, ...t_n$, satisfying $t_1< t_2 < ...<t_n$, then $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ is a stochastic process with **independent increments**.


### Process with Markovian property
$P(\text{ future } | \text{ present }, \text{ past })=P(\text{ future } | \text{ present })$

For a stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ with the **Markovian property**, future states $X(t_{i+1})$ depend only on the present state $X(t_i)$ and not the past states $X(t_{i-1}), X(t_{i-2}), ...X(t_{0})$. A stochastic process is called a **Markov process** if it has the Markovian property. If the state space of a Markov process is discrete, it's called a **Markov chain**.

It can be seen that the stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ has the Markovian property if, given the value of $X_t$, the values of $X_s$ for $s>t$ are not affected by the values of $X_u$ for $u<t$.

Formally, a stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ is a Markov processes if 

$$P(X_{n+1}=k_{n+1}|X_n = k_{n}, X_{n-1} = k_{n-1},...X_{1} = k_{1})=P(X_{n+1}=k_{n+1}|X_n = k_{n})$$

### Process with stationary increment 
A stochastic process $\left\{X(t):t\in T\right\}$ is said to have **stationary incerement** if the distribution of the increment $X(t_1+h)-X(t_1)$ depends only on the length $h$ of the interval and not on the time $t$.

For a stochastic process $\left\{X(t)\right\}$ with stationary increments, the distribution of $X(t)$ is the same for all $t$.
