# Waiting Line Theory or Queueing Model

## Definitions :
$(M/N/S):(C/D)$

$M$ - Arrival Pattern 
$N$ - Service Pattern
$S$ - Service Channels
$C$ - Service Capacity 
$D$ - Service Decipline 

e.g., $(M/N/1):(\infty/FIFO)$

A queue is formed when there is disbalance between number of servers and number of customers. 

A flow of customers from finite or infinite population towards the service facility forms a queue on account of lack of capability to serve them all at a time. 

In absence of perfect balence between the service facilities and the customers, waiting time is required either for the service facilities or the customer's arrival. 

Customer - An arriving unit waiting to be serviced. 
Queue - No of customers waiting to be serviced. 
Service Facility - The body providing the service.

*characteristics of arrivals*

**a) Size of arrivals** - Depends on the nature of size of the population (i.e. finite / infinite). More specifically described in terms of probabilities and probability distributions for inter-arrival time (time between two successive arrivals or the distribution of customers arriving in a unit time must be defined). 

> **Note:**
> For simplicity only Poisson arrivals are considered at the moment. 

**b) Inter-arrival time** - the period between two successive arrivals.
