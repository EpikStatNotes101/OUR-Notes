# Discrete Distributions
## Bernoullie Distribution
## Binomial Distribution

^29278e

A trial which has two independent outcomes (either success or failure, tails or heads, etc.) is called a **Bernoullie trial**.

If a random variable $X$ is defined such that $X$ is the number of successes in $n$ trials with $p$ probability, then $X\sim\text{Bin}(n, p)$

The Binomial distribution is an extention of the bernoullie distribution. Since the sum of $n$ independent Bernoullie random variables would follow a Binomial distribution. 

e.g., Suppose in a class of $n$ students, the probability of an individual student passing is $p$. Then the total number of students who pass ($X$) out of $n$ would follow a binomial distribution. 

### p.m.f of Binomial Distribution
$$X\sim\text{Binom}(n,p)$$
$$f_X(x)=\binom{n}{x}\cdot p^x \cdot (1-p)^{n-x}$$

### MGF of Binomial Distribution
$$M_X(t)=\mathbb{E}\left[ e^{tX} \right]$$
