# Discrete Distributions
## Bernoullie Distribution
## Binomial Distribution
A trial which has two independent outcomes (either success or failure, tails or heads, etc.) is called a **Bernoullie trial**.

If a random variable $X$ is defined such that $X$ is the number of successes in $n$ trials with $p$ probability, then $X\sim\text{Bin}(n, p)$

The Binomial distribution is an extention of the bernoullie distribution. Since the sum of $n$ independent Bernoullie random variables would follow a Binomial distribution.
