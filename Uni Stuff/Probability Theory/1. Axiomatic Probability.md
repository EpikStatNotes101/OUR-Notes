# Axiomatic Definition of Probability
$\Omega$ = Sample space (Collection of all possible outcomes of a random experiment)
$A$ = Event (Subset of a sample space)
$\mathcal{A}$ = Event space (The class of all possible events associated with a given experiment)

### Properties of $\mathcal{A}$
1. $\Omega\in \mathcal{A}$
