# Axiomatic Definition of Probability
$\Omega$ = Sample space (Collection of all possible outcomes of a random experiment)
$A$ = Event (Subset of a sample space)
$\mathcal{A}$ = Event space (The class of all possible events associated with a given experiment)

### Properties of $\mathcal{A}$
1. $\Omega\in \mathcal{A}$
2. If $A\in\mathcal{A}$, then $\bar{A}\in\mathcal{A}$
3. If $A_1 \;\&\; A_2 \in\mathcal{A}$, then $A_1\cup A_2\in\mathcal{A}$

any collection of events with properties 1 to 3 is called a *Boolean Algebra* or simply *Algebra*
