# Probability and Distributions
## Intro
Here we intuitively discuss the concepts of a probability model which we formalize in a later section. For many kinds of investigations, repeated experementation, under essentially the same condition is a standard procedure. E.g., in medical research interests may lie on the effect of drug to be administered; or an economist may be concerned with the price of three specefied commodities at various time intervals; e.t.c. The only way in which an investigator can elicit information about any such phenomenon is to perform the experiment. Each experiment terminates with an *outcome*. But it is characteristic of the experiments that the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty prior to the experiment.

>Suppose that we have such an experiment where the collection of every possible outcome of the experiment is known but the outcome itself cannot be predicted with certainty. If this kind of experiment can be repeated under the same condition, it is called a **random experiment**, and the collection of every possible outcome is called the **sample space**. We denote the sample space by $\zeta$.
