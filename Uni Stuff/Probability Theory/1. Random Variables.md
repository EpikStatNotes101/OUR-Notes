## Discrete Random Distributions
e.g. count, one-off
If a random variable $X$ follows a Discrete Probability Disttribution, it has a **Probabilty Mass Function (p.m.f)** $f_X(x)$associated with it such that
$$f_X(x) = P(X=x)$$
which satisfies the following criterias
1) $$0 \leq f_X(x)$$
2) $$\sum_{x=0}^\infty f_X(x)=1$$
