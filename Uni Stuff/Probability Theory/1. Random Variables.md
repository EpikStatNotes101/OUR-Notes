## Discrete Random Variables
e.g. count, one-off
If a random variable $X$ is discrete in nature, it has a **Probabilty Mass Function (p.m.f)** $f_X(x)$associated with it such that
$$f_X(x) = P(X=x)$$
which satisfies the following criterias
1) $$0 \leq f_X(x)$$
2) $$\sum_{x} f_X(x)=1$$

## Continous Random Variables
e.g. measurement (temperature, stock returns, times)
If a random variable $X$ follows a continous in nature, it has a **Probabilty Density Function (p.d.f)** $f_X(x)$ associated with it.

Unlike p.m.f's, for p.d.f's $f_X(x) \neq P(X=x)$. Instead the values of a p.d.f represent probability densities which can be interpreted as the measure of concentration probability over an interval

a p.d.f satisfies the following criterias
1) $$0 \leq f_X(x)$$
2) $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)\;dx=1$$

>**Note** For any continous r.v, $P(X=x)$ where $x$ is any arbitrary value of $X$ is $0$
