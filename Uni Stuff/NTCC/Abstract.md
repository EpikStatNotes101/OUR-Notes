Consistently throughout the days, Domestic Violence has been linked to degradingphysical and mental health and unpleasant social outcomes. Past studies have shown significant empirical evidence on the factors affecting Domestic Violence but very little importance has been given to the effect of income and education disparity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between income and education disparity and Domestic Violence in context of India. We use a sample of 66,000 women from the 4th National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) for India, conducted between 2014-2015. This study uses a standard logistic regression and decision tree to assess the effect of income and education inequality levels measured by the Gini-index on the different forms of Domestic Violence : emotional, physical and sexual. Along with income and education inequality, the analysis also has control variables for other determinants for Domestic Violence that are vastly used in literature. Results show a statistically aignificant positive association between income and education inequality and Domestic Violence in India. Findings also show that the type of religion and caste / tribe to influence the likelihood of being a victim of Domestic Violence. Policies decreasing income and education inequality would in turn decrease the level of Domestic Violence against women.
