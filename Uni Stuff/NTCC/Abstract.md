Consistently throughout the days, Domestic Violence (DV) has been linked to degrading physical and mental health and unpleasant social outcomes. Past studies have shown significant empirical evidence on the determinants of the chances of experiencing DV, but very little importance has been given to the effect of income and education disparity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between income and education disparity and DV in context of India. We use a sample of 64,582 women from the 4th National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) for India, conducted between 2014-2015. This study uses a standard logistic regression and decision tree to assess the effect of income and education disparity levels measured by the Gini-index, on the different forms of DV: emotional, physical, and sexual. Along with income and education disparity, the analyses also have control variables for other determinants for DV that are vastly used in literature. Results show a statistically significant positive association between income and education disparity and DV in India. Findings also show that the type of religion and caste / tribe to influence the likelihood of being a victim of DV. Policies decreasing income and education disparity would in turn decrease the level of DV against women.
