# Intro
Bayesian Inference revolves around the idea of the Bayes' rule, which is 
$$\frac{\text{likelihood}\cdot\text{prior}}{\text{denominator}}=\text{posterior}$$
Which in term of probability distributions is
$$\frac{p(X|\theta)\cdot p(\theta)}{p(X)}=p(\theta|X)$$
While classical or frequentist Inference is just concerned with the $\text{likelihood}$
