# Point Estimation 
## Intro	
### Random Sampling 
Suppose an experiment results in outcomes $x$ which are values assumed by a r.v. $X$
$$X\sim F$$
This means that $n$ values observed as $x_1,x_2,...x_n$ are assumed by $X$ \[this can be obtained by repeating the experiment under (more or less) identical conditions]. 
$$X_1,X_2,...X_n \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} F$$
The set of r.v's $(X_1,X_2,...X_n)$ is called a random sample from the distribution $F$ and the set of values $(x_1,x_2,...x_n)$ is called a realization of the sample. 
### Parameter and Parameter Space
A constant which changes its value from one situation to another is a known parameter, denoted by $\theta$ ($\theta$ might be a vector). The set of all admissible values of a parameter is often called the parameter space, denoted by $\Theta$.
