# Point Estimation 
## Intro	
### Random Sampling 
Suppose an experiment results in outcomes $x$ which are values assumed by a r.v. $X$
$$X\sim F$$
This means that $n$ values observed as $x_1,x_2,...x_n$ are assumed by $X$ \[this can be obtained by repeating the experiment under (more or less) identical conditions]. 
$$X_1,X_2,...X_n \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} F$$
The set of r.v's $(X_1,X_2,...X_n)$ is called a random sample from the distribution $F$ and the set of values $(x_1,x_2,...x_n)$ is called a realization of the sample. 
### Parameter and Parameter Space
A constant which changes its value from one situation to another is a known parameter, denoted by $\theta$ ($\theta$ might be a vector). The set of all admissible values of a parameter is often called the parameter space, denoted by $\Theta$.

### Statistic
### Estimator and Estimate
## Sufficient Statistic
Let $\underset{\sim}{X} = (X_1,X_2,...X_n)$ be a random sample from $\left\{ F_{\theta}, \theta \in \Theta \right\}$. A statistic $T(\underset{\sim}{X})$ is said to be sufficient for $\theta$ \[or for the family of distribution $\left\{ F_{\theta}, \theta \in \Theta \right\}$] iff the conditional distribution of $\underset{\sim}{X}$ given $T$ is free from $\theta$

### Fisher-Neyman Factorization Theorem
Let $\underset{\sim}{X} = (X_1,X_2,...X_n)$ be a random sample with c.d.f. $F_\theta\;, \theta\in\Theta$. Let all $X_i$'s be discrete or continous.

Then a statististic $T(\underset{\sim}{X})$ is sufficient for $\theta$ iff the joint p.d.f. or p.m.f. $f(\underset{\sim}{X}, \theta)$, of $X_1,X_2,...X_n$ can be expressed as, 
$$f(\underset{\sim}{X}, \theta)=g\left\{T(\underset{\sim}{X}), \theta \right\}\cdot h(\underset{\sim}{X})$$

Where the first factor $g\left\{T(\underset{\sim}{X}), \theta \right\}$ is a function of $\theta$ and $x$ only through $T(\underset{\sim}{X})$ and for fixed $T(\underset{\sim}{X})$ the second factor $h\left(\underset{\sim}{X}\right)$ is free from $\theta$ and is non-negative.
