## Risk Assessment 
Assess the overall statewise risk (contamination, death). 

Split the states into 3 categories (low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk)

## Sample States 
Draw $n$ samples from each of the 3 risk categories

### Alt method
Sample according to population ratios.

Denote state risks by : High Risk $H$, Intermediate Risk $M$, Low Risk $L$

Suppose we have states in every categories as follows :
